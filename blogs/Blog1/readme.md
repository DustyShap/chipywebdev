Chicago Python Web Dev Mentee Track//



Coming in to this track, I had a good idea for a web application that I wanted to develop.
Imagining the steps to build this application, I had the basics down, but was excited to start
my menteeship to fill in the holes of my knowledge gap.  I knew the best approach was going to take it one step at a time. 

My first step was to create the layout, from scratch, using HTML/CSS.  My mentor Feihong quickly
recommend I  check out CSS flexboxing for easy element layouts, and using CodePen, I was able to whip up a layout
using flex display to achieve a layout I wanted, based on the feedback of my mentor.
It seems with HTML and CSS, there are 100 different ways to achieve something, but Feihong provided some good suggestions
for efficient ways to carry out what I was hoping to achieve.

I put together a few mock ups of the layout based on how we decided the application would look best.  Feihong provided good feedback
for simplifying my HTML elements, and in turn, simplifying the stylesheet and any JS.  I took what I had with CodePen and decided
to start the project using PyCharm, so I could begin on the backend.  I took what I had learned from the first few iterations of the 
layout, and used it to complete a simple version using flex displays.  

Once I was at a good spot with my layout, it was time to focus on the next task, which was using AJAX to serve up search results on a single page
style app.  My previous knowledge of passing data from server to client relied on form submission, so it was time to team with Feihong to go over 
the basics of AJAX.  Once we went over that, it was back to tackle a new challenge.  Once I learned how to retrieve the data from the server via
an AJAX call, it was time to dive into some jQuery in order to dynamically return/display result objects.  

I am really enjoying seeing this project come to fruition.  It is something I have thought of developing for a long time now, and this web dev 
menteeship is really proving to be the structure and motivation to finally take on the challenge.  

Until next update...
