At this point, I am happy where the application is.  If today was some sort of faux deadline to never work on it past this point, I would truly be happy with its functionality. Although, once I progressed through the project, and I realized what could be possible, potential future feature additions started to add up.  Ideas such as adding unique login sessions, whereas each user could "save the state" of their drop deck, so when they exit and return, it is still there.  Another idea would be to add a drop down menu, which would load the deck full of audio clips correlating to what was chosen in the menu.  I know, though, that the program/mentorship is wrapping up, so I want to ensure that what I have now is presentable.  

I think the first step, in the final few weeks of this, is to refactor.  Take a step back, review the code I have currently, with the knowledge I've gained since it's inception, and using that knowledge to make the current version better.  Breaking out the Javascript into individual files based on functionality within the app.  Making naming conventions within my HTML a bit more consistent, and just better overall formatting.  

Along with working on the application, and getting it to a good point to present, is starting to brainstorm the final presentation of the application.  Because I had to learn each component of the app, including HTML/CSS, one step at a time, my early idea is to present it in the order I learned.  Start with the basics of the frontend, move into formless submission/AJAX and into more advanced features of JS/jQuery.  Present it in that order, along with presenting the application as a solution for a problem, for a radio show that I am passionate about, I think would make a compelling final presentation.  

Until that time...
