So now I have the layout of the application at a point where I am happy.  The styling could have more flair, but the application of this is more
utilitarian.  I did impart some drop shadows into the grid, which is essentially the pinnacle of web styling (I hear).  

The next step in this application is one that I feel is most crucial.  Taking a search result from the results list, and appending it to a cell on the deck.  The biggest problem I was looking to solve with this application rested within this functionality.  I pondered with Feihong the best way to carry this out.  Perhaps choosing a number and sending the result information to a numbered cell? If you're going to do, do it right, so I decided the drag and drop method would be ideal.  
 
 Dragging and dropping in HTML seemed to be one of the lesser documented functions that I had to learn for this so far.  The examples I had seen were all in vanilla Javascript, as opposed to jQuery, but in hindsight, I think that was valuable, as I was able to be exposed, and practice vanilla JS, as opposed to jQuery.  It did, though, make me appreciate jQuery a bit more when dealing with HTML DOM manipulation.
  
  I probably typed "console.log()" into either the source code or the console at least 10,000 times when trying this.  Ensuring I was grabbing, passing, and/or receiving the correct data in the correct format with the drag and drop events was definitely a process.  One thing I really learned to appreciate is the blood, sweat and tears that goes into developing what seems like an easy/simple function of the app, but in reality on the backend there is a lot more complexity than assumed.  
  
  Completing this portion of the app, and being happy with it's look and functionality, truly felt like a milestone.  One of the biggest motivations for this application was to make a specific person's job easier, and with the drag and drop functionality as well as the quick search on a single page, I felt like the solution was really starting to come to fruition as I first imagined it with Feihong.
  
  Until next time..
